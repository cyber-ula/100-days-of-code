# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [cyber-ula]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 22, Friday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Learned React Forms. Worked on my API, reading Architecture Patterns with Python.

### R1D2
Today, just finished Forms in React and created descriptions on top and bottom on my meme generator. Also, just started learning useEffect().

### R1D3
Just finished the meme generator. Yes, I need to change the styling a little bit to fit the description top and bottom to size the image, but it is not too bad. It's my first time deploying React App :)
